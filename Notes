Java was conceived by James Gosling, Patrick Naughton, Chris Warth, Ed Frank, and Mike Sheridan at Sun Microsystems in 1991


platform independent language that could be used to create software to be embedded in various
 consumer electronic devices, such as toasters, microwave ovens, and remote controls.
 As you can probably guess, many different types of CPUs are used as controllers

The two languages that form Java’s closest ancestors are C and C++. As you may know,
 C and C++ are among the most important computer languages ever invented and are
 still in widespread use today. From C, Java inherits its syntax. Java’s object model is
 adapted from C++. Java’s relationship to C and C++ is important for a number of
 reasons. First, at the time of Java’s creation, many programmers were familiar with the
 C/C++ syntax. Because Java uses a similar syntax, it was relatively easy for a C/C++
 programmer to learn Java. This made it possible for Java to be readily utilized by the
 pool of existing programmers, thus facilitating Java’s acceptance by the programming
 community.
